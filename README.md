The miRmap library is a Python library predicting the repression strength of microRNA (miRNA) targets. The model combines thermodynamic, evolutionary, probabilistic, or sequence-based approaches.

This library is Python 3 compatible rewrite of miRmap. WIP.

The miRmap library is distributed under the GNU GPL v3 (see /LICENCE).
