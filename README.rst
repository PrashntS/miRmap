miRmap - Comprehensive prediction of microRNA target repression strength
========================================================================

The miRmap library is a Python library predicting the repression strength of microRNA (miRNA) targets. The model combines thermodynamic, evolutionary, probabilistic, or sequence-based approaches.

See `miRmap web site <http://mirmap.ezlab.org>`_ for installation and usage details.
